In contrast, General Practice and standalone Emergency services demonstrate lower conversion rates at 2.66% and 2.43%, respectively, indicating potential inefficiencies or client hesitancy in scheduling appointments after an initial call. Conversion rates vary significantly across veterinary services, emphasizing the need for tailored client engagement to improve appointment scheduling efficiency.\nSource: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/138O2hoyIlJBsnt1MMmv_GEOSGx2Jjdu_#scrollTo=e6890987\n\nMarketing Narrative\nCall management is a major cost center for veterinary hospitals, yet often overlooked. GuardianVets doesn’t just handle overflow—it transforms how clinics manage client inquiries, reducing costs and inefficiencies.\nHiring a veterinary receptionist costs $1,633 per hire, agency recruitment jumps to $5,250, and training adds another $1,250. With high turnover, these costs add up fast. Meanwhile, GuardianVets handles around 800,000 calls annually, but CSRs can only handle around 195,000. Each call takes time away from patient care.\nBy automating client communication, GuardianVets minimizes hiring costs, optimizes staff efficiency, and ensures hospitals focus on patient care and growth—not administrative burden. Instead of just improving client engagement, GuardianVets is a financial and staffing solution that directly impacts profitability.\nMethodology\nTo calculate the Call-to-Appointment Conversion Rate (CACR), data was first extracted from Power BI, which included records of incoming calls and scheduled appointments categorized by service type: Emergency, Emergency & Specialty, General Practice, and Mobile Veterinary Services. The data was then filtered to remove incomplete, irrelevant, or duplicate records before being exported into a structured CSV format for further processing.\nFollowing data collection, a data cleaning and preprocessing phase was conducted to ensure accuracy and consistency. All missing or incomplete records were eliminated to prevent skewed analysis. Datasets from different veterinary service categories were merged into a unified DataFrame, creating a standardized dataset that allowed for cross-comparisons.\nThe Call-to-Appointment Conversion Rate was determined using the formula: (Total Appointments by specialty / Total Calls by specialty) x 100. This calculation provided a percentage-based measurement of how effectively each service type converted inquiries into scheduled appointments.\nTo validate and analyze the results, several statistical measures were applied. Descriptive statistics, including mean, median, and standard deviation, were calculated to assess trends and variations in conversion rates across service types. A seaborn boxplot was generated to visualize distribution patterns and detect potential outliers in the dataset. Additionally, a Kruskal-Wallis H-test was performed to determine whether the differences in conversion rates among the various veterinary service categories were statistically significant.\nAdditional Segmentation Metrics \nSeveral clinic-specific factors were identified that could impact conversion rates. Larger clinics with more veterinarians and front desk staff tend to manage higher call volumes, which may influence appointment scheduling efficiency. The range of services offered also plays a role, as clinics providing specialized care, emergency procedures, or telemedicine consultations often experience higher or more unpredictable call volumes. Clinics that operate 24/7 or offer weekend availability see increased inquiries, particularly for emergency cases. Call response time is another crucial factor, as quicker responses to client inquiries improve scheduling rates and overall retention.\nGeographic location also affects call-to-appointment conversion rates. Urban clinics generally receive higher call volumes due to larger pet populations and greater accessibility, while rural clinics may experience surges in emergency inquiries, particularly in regions with limited veterinary alternatives. Seasonal and regional health concerns, such as flea infestations or pet anxiety during holiday travel, also contribute to fluctuating call activity.\n\nAverage Transaction Size\nResults\nAverage Transaction Size (ATS) is a key financial metric used to evaluate revenue efficiency per client interaction. By analyzing ATS across different veterinary hospital specialties—Emergency, Emergency & Specialty, General Practice, and Mobile Services—this research identifies revenue generation patterns and operational efficiency. The ATS for each category is calculated as follows: Emergency hospitals have an ATS of $48.08 per call, while Emergency & Specialty hospitals have the highest ATS at $62.71 per call. General Practice hospitals show the lowest ATS at $2.32 per call, indicating lower revenue per client interaction. Mobile Services maintain a moderate ATS of $23.49 per call, suggesting a balance between accessibility and revenue efficiency.\n\nSource: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fApbPN6WSYeMfo8Hm1aqcvXX3JbO66Os#scrollTo=d825765a\nMarketing Narrative\nAverage Transaction Size (ATS) is a key metric for veterinary hospitals to demonstrate the value of their services. GuardianVets helps hospitals optimize client communication by improving appointment scheduling and reducing missed opportunities, ultimately leading to higher ATS and increased revenue.\nHospitals with higher ATS often provide advanced diagnostics, specialized treatments, and expert care, but inefficiencies in client communication can lead to missed appointments and a failure to fully convey this value. For example, an Emergency & Specialty hospital with a high ATS can market this as covering premium services—but this value can be missed if the client is unable to schedule appointments or understand the full scope of care offered.\nGuardianVets not only streamlines call management but also supports transparency in communication. By ensuring clients clearly understand what their payments cover—from diagnostic tests to imaging and treatment plans—GuardianVets enhances trust and clarity in the value of services. This improves client retention, optimizes ATS, and drives long-term profitability, all while reinforcing a hospital's commitment to clear and honest communication.\nMethodology\nThe ATS analysis was conducted through multiple stages, including data cleaning, preprocessing, revenue computation, and segmentation. The data from the four veterinary specialties were imported and merged into a single DataFrame for uniform analysis. Any missing data in the Appointments or Total Calls columns were removed using the dropna() function to ensure accurate revenue calculations. Attendance rates were mapped to each hospital specialty using predefined industry averages. These rates were applied using the .map() function, allowing for precise adjustments in revenue estimates. The attendance rates used were 95% for Emergency hospitals, 93% for Emergency & Specialty hospitals, 89% for General Practice hospitals, and 89% for Mobile Services.

This preprocessing step prepared the dataset for mathematical operations.\nThe number of actual appointments kept was estimated using the formula Appointments Kept = Appointments × Attendance Rate. This calculation was performed using vectorized operations in pandas, allowing efficient processing of thousands of data entries. Incremental Revenue was then calculated using the formula Incremental Revenue = Appointments Kept × Revenue per Appointment. The revenue per appointment was assigned based on specialty, with Emergency hospitals averaging $2125 per appointment, Emergency & Specialty hospitals at $1000, General Practice hospitals at $100, and Mobile Services at $100. (Source: Costs of Emergency Veterinary Care: What to Know, How Much Does a Vet Visit Cost? Average Pricing By Procedure, How Much Does a Vet Visit Cost? Average Pricing By Procedure, Mobile Vet Care Costs and Pricing Comparison | The Vets) A lambda function applied these revenue rates dynamically across the dataset.\nThe final ATS values were derived using the formula ATS = Incremental Revenue / Total Calls. To prevent errors such as division by zero, np.where() was used to replace missing or zero values with NaN before computing the ratio. Once ATS was computed, the dataset was grouped by Hospital Specialty to analyze performance variations. A boxplot generated using the seaborn library, and summary statistics segmented by specialty provided insights into high-revenue categories and potential areas for improvement.\nAdditional Segmentation Metrics \n\nBeyond specialty-based ATS, further segmentation opportunities include client type segmentation, service type impact, and time-based analysis. Client type segmentation involves differentiating ATS between new and returning clients to assess loyalty-driven revenue patterns. Service type impact focuses on comparing ATS for diagnostics, surgical treatments, and preventative care to identify the most profitable services. Time-based analysis examines ATS variations between peak and off-peak hours to optimize pricing strategies and staff allocation. By using segmentation metrics, GuardianVets helps veterinary hospitals optimize client communication and scheduling, highlighting the value of their services. With better call management and transparency, hospitals can demonstrate the full value of treatments, improve client trust, and ultimately maximize profitability across different service areas.\n\n\nCustomer Satisfaction Scores\nResults\nMarketing Narrative\nMethodology\nAdditional Segmentation Metrics \n\nRecruitment and Training Costs \nResults\nRecruitment and training costs play a big role in veterinary clinic spending throughout a clinic’s lifetime. On average, they spend between $10,000 and $25,000 on recruitment, and more specific numbers can be found in the methodology section of this metric. In addition, our Power BI data was used to assess hiring needs based on call volumes, with CVT’s handling 866,000 total calls in a year, and CSR’s handling 195,000 total calls in a year. Finally, our segmentation further displayed the amount of calls and receptionists hospitals segmented by size(small, medium, large), receive, and all of these statistics are used to paint a coherent picture about both the true possible impact of GuardianVets, and how this can be spun using a marketing narrative standpoint.\n\nMarketing Narrative\nCall volume takes up so much of a part of veterinary clinic’s proceedings- GuardianVets essentially automating this service saves both recruitment time and funds. A general veterinary receptionist costs about $1,633/hire, a vet-receptionist from a recruitment agency costs about $5,250/hire, a job posting from a clinic costs about $200/hire, and it’s $1,250 for in-house training.  \n\nIn addition, according to our Power BI Data, veterinary clinics have certain statistics showing just how exorbitant call volumes can become- CVT’s(Certified Veterinary Technicians) get around 866,000 total calls in a year, with CSR(Client Service Representatives) getting around 195,000 total calls in a year. Clinics themselves get around 4 million calls in a year handled through the org. Automating this process with GuardianVets speaks for itself, based simply on the call volumes it’d essentially nullify.\n\nWith the exorbitant numbers training costs can reach, and the amount GuardianVets can save, the choice to choose GuardianVets is obvious. \nMethodology\n\nAssumptions\n\nTo make assumptions about salaries and hiring costs for veterinary receptionists, we relied on industry standards and recruitment data. According to available figures, the average cost to hire a General Veterinary Receptionist is $1,633. However, using a recruitment agency significantly increases costs, ranging from $5,250 to $8,750 per hire. Posting a job on a job board costs approximately $193 per listing, which is a more budget-friendly option. Additionally, training expenses vary, with online training costing $800 per new hire, while in-house training costs around $1,250 per new hire. These figures provide a clear benchmark for estimating the overall investment in hiring and training veterinary receptionists.\n\nPower BI Data\n\nWe derived these call volume figures using Power BI, analyzing data from our call management system to categorize and quantify total interactions, and assess hiring needs based on call volumes. The data revealed that Certified Veterinary Technicians (CVTs) handled approximately 866,000 calls, while Client Service Representatives (CSRs) managed around 195,000 calls. These figures were extracted by filtering call logs based on employee roles and call activity records. In total, the system logged 4 million calls, which includes all veterinary-related inquiries, scheduling requests, and client communications across various roles. By leveraging Power BI's data visualization and reporting tools, we ensured accurate aggregation and segmentation of call volumes for a comprehensive understanding of workload distribution. These statistics can also be used to visualize hiring needs different clinics with differing sizes and receptionist numbers can have.\n\nSegmentation\n\nTo segment hospitals by size, we used call volume data and staffing levels, categorizing them into large, medium, and small hospitals. A large hospital, such as Community Veterinary Medicine, handled 6,923 calls in 2024 and required five receptionists to manage the workload efficiently. A medium-sized hospital, like Newton Animal Clinic, processed 1,160 calls with one receptionist. Meanwhile, a small hospital, such as Best Pets Veterinary Hospital, had 106 calls recorded and operates with one dedicated receptionist.\n\nAdditional Segmentation Metrics \n\nIn the future, we’d like to segment hospital sizes using more accurate data- if there’s any specific data as to how many receptionists big, medium, and small clinics have, as well as the amount of calls they’d receive per day, it’d make our numbers more accurate.\n\n\nEmployee Salary Savings \nTo quantify salary savings, we analyzed the time veterinarians and customer service (CS) agents save by offloading phone call handling. On average, veterinarians save 252.81 minutes per day, allowing them to dedicate more time to patient care. Customer service agents also reduce their workload significantly, particularly in handling appointment bookings.\nResults\n\nOur analysis of hospital call management shows that total call durations range from approximately 180,000 to over 500,000 minutes annually per hospital. Emergency calls, follow-ups, and consultations handled by veterinarians contribute significantly to workload. Depending on the hospital, veterinarians save between 56 and 182 minutes per day, while CS agents save between 84 and 274 minutes daily. These efficiency gains reduce opportunity costs, allowing medical professionals to focus on patient care rather than administrative tasks.\n\nMarketing Narrative\nVeterinary hospitals deal with a constant flow of calls, from appointment bookings to emergency consultations, which take up a significant amount of time for both veterinarians and customer service agents. By shifting call management away from veterinarians, hospitals can free up valuable hours that would otherwise be spent on the phone. This allows vets to focus on what matters most—treating patients—while also improving overall efficiency.\nReducing call-handling time doesn’t just help veterinarians; it also enhances the customer experience. Clients get faster responses without long hold times, leading to better service and satisfaction. At the same time, employees face less stress from constantly managing calls, reducing burnout and improving job retention.\nFor hospitals, this solution is an easy way to optimize operations without adding more staff. With better time management, hospitals can take on more patients, increase revenue, and ensure their team works at full capacity in the most effective way possible.\nMethodology\nTo estimate opportunity cost savings, we categorized incoming hospital calls into four types: appointment bookings, consultations, emergency calls, and follow-ups. Each category was assigned a handling time based on industry norms and hospital workflows. Appointment bookings, which constituted 60% of total calls, had an estimated handling time of 2 to 5 minutes per call and were handled exclusively by customer service agents. Consultations, making up 20% of calls, took between 10 and 15 minutes per call and were managed by veterinarians. Emergency calls accounted for 10% of calls, requiring between 15 and 30 minutes per call, while follow-up calls made up another 10%, with an average duration of 5 to 10 minutes. Both emergency and follow-up calls were handled entirely by veterinarians.\nUsing this distribution, we calculated the total time spent on each call category per hospital by applying the corresponding percentages to the hospital's total call duration data. For example, if a hospital had a total call duration of 400,000 minutes annually, approximately 240,000 minutes were spent on appointment bookings, 80,000 minutes on consultations, 40,000 minutes on emergency calls, and 40,000 minutes on follow-ups.\nSince appointment bookings were handled solely by customer service agents, we calculated their total work hours spent on calls separately. For veterinarians, we aggregated the minutes spent on consultations, emergency calls, and follow-ups to determine their total time allocated to phone handling. The estimated time savings for each hospital was calculated based on the assumption that veterinarians no longer handle any phone calls, allowing them to allocate this recovered time to patient care.\nTo determine the daily time saved per veterinarian, we divided the total saved minutes by 5 (years) * 260 (working days), assuming consistent call volumes throughout the year. Individual hospital time savings ranged from 56 to 182 minutes per day for veterinarians, while CS agents saved between 84 and 274 minutes daily.\nAssumptions\nThis analysis relies on the following assumptions:\nThe call distribution percentages—60% appointment bookings, 20% consultations, 10% emergency calls, and 10% follow-ups—are estimates due to the absence of categorized call data.\nEach veterinarian and customer service agent operates at full efficiency within their respective call handling roles.\nThe five-year cost savings projection assumes a constant call volume over time.\nAppointment bookings are managed entirely by customer service agents, while veterinarians handle all other call types.\nIn this model, veterinarians are assumed to be fully dedicated to phone call management during work hours, with no in-person patient interactions included in their workload.\nAdditional Segmentation Metrics \nThis analysis can be further segmented to refine insights and account for variations across hospitals. One way to segment is by hospital size, since larger hospitals with higher call volumes tend to see greater cumulative time savings. A second approach is by call distribution, where hospitals with a higher percentage of consultations and emergency calls benefit more from offloading calls, as these require longer handling times.\nGeographical location also plays a role, since regions with higher labor costs will experience greater financial savings from time efficiencies. Another way to segment is by the ratio of veterinarians to customer service agents. Hospitals where veterinarians handle a disproportionate share of calls see the highest impact from offloading phone work, whereas hospitals with a more balanced distribution may experience different efficiency dynamics.\nClient Retention Rate \nResults\nLast semester’s analysis found that 37.46% of customers would have called another clinic if GuardianVets wasn’t available, highlighting its role in retention. Additionally, 95% of clients want their vet to keep GuardianVets, reinforcing its value as a “luxury” service. With an average hold time of 2.5 minutes—compared to the industry’s 4.4 minutes—GuardianVets enhances accessibility and client experience. While traditional retention metrics fall short, tracking long-term engagement trends between clinics using GuardianVets and those that don’t can further validate its impact on client retention and practice growth.\nMarketing Narrative\nGuardianVets strengthens the bond between veterinarians and their clients by ensuring accessible, high-quality after-hours support. With 95% of customers valuing the service and faster response times than industry standards, it enhances client satisfaction and loyalty. By positioning GuardianVets as a premium, must-have service, clinics can differentiate themselves and drive long-term retention.\nMethodology\nThe methodology involved collecting and analyzing survey data to gauge client retention and satisfaction with GuardianVets. The team examined customer responses to the “what would you have done” question, segmenting data to determine how many clients would have called another clinic versus waiting for business hours. Additionally, call hold times were compared, highlighting GuardianVets' efficiency against industry standards. Recognizing the limitations of traditional retention metrics, the study reframed retention as value-added to veterinary practices, similar to customer satisfaction. Future research will focus on tracking long-term engagement trends between clinics that use GuardianVets and those that do not, providing deeper insights into its impact on client retention and practice growth.\nAdditional Segmentation Metrics \nAdditional segmentation metrics include analyzing call types to differentiate between administrative inquiries and urgent concerns, tracking client engagement patterns over time, and comparing retention trends between clinics using GuardianVets and those that do not.\n\n\nConcluding Remarks \n\n",

On average, they spend between $10,000 and $25,000 on recruitment, and more specific numbers can be found in the methodology section of this metric. In addition, our Power BI data was used to assess hiring needs based on call volumes, with CVT’s handling 866,000 total calls in a year, and CSR’s handling 195,000 total calls in a year. Finally, our segmentation further displayed the amount of calls and receptionists hospitals segmented by size(small, medium, large), receive, and all of these statistics are used to paint a coherent picture about both the true possible impact of GuardianVets, and how this can be spun using a marketing narrative standpoint.\n\nMarketing Narrative\nCall volume takes up so much of a part of veterinary clinic’s proceedings- GuardianVets essentially automating this service saves both recruitment time and funds. A general veterinary receptionist costs about $1,633/hire, a vet-receptionist from a recruitment agency costs about $5,250/hire, a job posting from a clinic costs about $200/hire, and it’s $1,250 for in-house training.  \n\nIn addition, according to our Power BI Data, veterinary clinics have certain statistics showing just how exorbitant call volumes can become- CVT’s(Certified Veterinary Technicians) get around 866,000 total calls in a year, with CSR(Client Service Representatives) getting around 195,000 total calls in a year. Clinics themselves get around 4 million calls in a year handled through the org. Automating this process with GuardianVets speaks for itself, based simply on the call volumes it’d essentially nullify.\n\nWith the exorbitant numbers training costs can reach, and the amount GuardianVets can save, the choice to choose GuardianVets is obvious. \nMethodology\n\nAssumptions\n\nTo make assumptions about salaries and hiring costs for veterinary receptionists, we relied on industry standards and recruitment data. According to available figures, the average cost to hire a General Veterinary Receptionist is $1,633. However, using a recruitment agency significantly increases costs, ranging from $5,250 to $8,750 per hire. Posting a job on a job board costs approximately $193 per listing, which is a more budget-friendly option. Additionally, training expenses vary, with online training costing $800 per new hire, while in-house training costs around $1,250 per new hire. These figures provide a clear benchmark for estimating the overall investment in hiring and training veterinary receptionists.\n\nPower BI Data\n\nWe derived these call volume figures using Power BI, analyzing data from our call management system to categorize and quantify total interactions, and assess hiring needs based on call volumes. The data revealed that Certified Veterinary Technicians (CVTs) handled approximately 866,000 calls, while Client Service Representatives (CSRs) managed around 195,000 calls. These figures were extracted by filtering call logs based on employee roles and call activity records. In total, the system logged 4 million calls, which includes all veterinary-related inquiries, scheduling requests, and client communications across various roles. By leveraging Power BI's data visualization and reporting tools, we ensured accurate aggregation and segmentation of call volumes for a comprehensive understanding of workload distribution. These statistics can also be used to visualize hiring needs different clinics with differing sizes and receptionist numbers can have.\n\nSegmentation\n\nTo segment hospitals by size, we used call volume data and staffing levels, categorizing them into large, medium, and small hospitals. A large hospital, such as Community Veterinary Medicine, handled 6,923 calls in 2024 and required five receptionists to manage the workload efficiently. A medium-sized hospital, like Newton Animal Clinic, processed 1,160 calls with one receptionist. Meanwhile, a small hospital, such as Best Pets Veterinary Hospital, had 106 calls recorded and operates with one dedicated receptionist.\n\nAdditional Segmentation Metrics \n\nIn the future, we’d like to segment hospital sizes using more accurate data- if there’s any specific data as to how many receptionists big, medium, and small clinics have, as well as the amount of calls they’d receive per day, it’d make our numbers more accurate.\n\n\nEmployee Salary Savings \nTo quantify salary savings, we analyzed the time veterinarians and customer service (CS) agents save by offloading phone call handling. On average, veterinarians save 252.81 minutes per day, allowing them to dedicate more time to patient care. Customer service agents also reduce their workload significantly, particularly in handling appointment bookings.\nResults\n\nOur analysis of hospital call management shows that total call durations range from approximately 180,000 to over 500,000 minutes annually per hospital. Emergency calls, follow-ups, and consultations handled by veterinarians contribute significantly to workload. Depending on the hospital, veterinarians save between 56 and 182 minutes per day, while CS agents save between 84 and 274 minutes daily. These efficiency gains reduce opportunity costs, allowing medical professionals to focus on patient care rather than administrative tasks.\n\nMarketing Narrative\nVeterinary hospitals deal with a constant flow of calls, from appointment bookings to emergency consultations, which take up a significant amount of time for both veterinarians and customer service agents. By shifting call management away from veterinarians, hospitals can free up valuable hours that would otherwise be spent on the phone. This allows vets to focus on what matters most—treating patients—while also improving overall efficiency.\nReducing call-handling time doesn’t just help veterinarians; it also enhances the customer experience. Clients get faster responses without long hold times, leading to better service and satisfaction. At the same time, employees face less stress from constantly managing calls, reducing burnout and improving job retention.\nFor hospitals, this solution is an easy way to optimize operations without adding more staff. With better time management, hospitals can take on more patients, increase revenue, and ensure their team works at full capacity in the most effective way possible.\nMethodology\nTo estimate opportunity cost savings, we categorized incoming hospital calls into four types: appointment bookings, consultations, emergency calls, and follow-ups. Each category was assigned a handling time based on industry norms and hospital workflows. Appointment bookings, which constituted 60% of total calls, had an estimated handling time of 2 to 5 minutes per call and were handled exclusively by customer service agents. Consultations, making up 20% of calls, took between 10 and 15 minutes per call and were managed by veterinarians. Emergency calls accounted for 10% of calls, requiring between 15 and 30 minutes per call, while follow-up calls made up another 10%, with an average duration of 5 to 10 minutes. Both emergency and follow-up calls were handled entirely by veterinarians.\nUsing this distribution, we calculated the total time spent on each call category per hospital by applying the corresponding percentages to the hospital's total call duration data. For example, if a hospital had a total call duration of 400,000 minutes annually, approximately 240,000 minutes were spent on appointment bookings, 80,000 minutes on consultations, 40,000 minutes on emergency calls, and 40,000 minutes on follow-ups.\nSince appointment bookings were handled solely by customer service agents, we calculated their total work hours spent on calls separately. For veterinarians, we aggregated the minutes spent on consultations, emergency calls, and follow-ups to determine their total time allocated to phone handling. The estimated time savings for each hospital was calculated based on the assumption that veterinarians no longer handle any phone calls, allowing them to allocate this recovered time to patient care.\nTo determine the daily time saved per veterinarian, we divided the total saved minutes by 5 (years) * 260 (working days), assuming consistent call volumes throughout the year. Individual hospital time savings ranged from 56 to 182 minutes per day for veterinarians, while CS agents saved between 84 and 274 minutes daily.\nAssumptions\nThis analysis relies on the following assumptions:\nThe call distribution percentages—60% appointment bookings, 20% consultations, 10% emergency calls, and 10% follow-ups—are estimates due to the absence of categorized call data.\nEach veterinarian and customer service agent operates at full efficiency within their respective call handling roles.\nThe five-year cost savings projection assumes a constant call volume over time.\nAppointment bookings are managed entirely by customer service agents, while veterinarians handle all other call types.\nIn this model, veterinarians are assumed to be fully dedicated to phone call management during work hours, with no in-person patient interactions included in their workload.\nAdditional Segmentation Metrics \nThis analysis can be further segmented to refine insights and account for variations across hospitals. One way to segment is by hospital size, since larger hospitals with higher call volumes tend to see greater cumulative time savings. A second approach is by call distribution, where hospitals with a higher percentage of consultations and emergency calls benefit more from offloading calls, as these require longer handling times.\nGeographical location also plays a role, since regions with higher labor costs will experience greater financial savings from time efficiencies. Another way to segment is by the ratio of veterinarians to customer service agents. Hospitals where veterinarians handle a disproportionate share of calls see the highest impact from offloading phone work, whereas hospitals with a more balanced distribution may experience different efficiency dynamics.\nClient Retention Rate \nResults\nLast semester’s analysis found that 37.46% of customers would have called another clinic if GuardianVets wasn’t available, highlighting its role in retention. Additionally, 95% of clients want their vet to keep GuardianVets, reinforcing its value as a “luxury” service. With an average hold time of 2.5 minutes—compared to the industry’s 4.4 minutes—GuardianVets enhances accessibility and client experience. While traditional retention metrics fall short, tracking long-term engagement trends between clinics using GuardianVets and those that don’t can further validate its impact on client retention and practice growth.\nMarketing Narrative\nGuardianVets strengthens the bond between veterinarians and their clients by ensuring accessible, high-quality after-hours support. With 95% of customers valuing the service and faster response times than industry standards, it enhances client satisfaction and loyalty. By positioning GuardianVets as a premium, must-have service, clinics can differentiate themselves and drive long-term retention.\nMethodology\nThe methodology involved collecting and analyzing survey data to gauge client retention and satisfaction with GuardianVets. The team examined customer responses to the “what would you have done” question, segmenting data to determine how many clients would have called another clinic versus waiting for business hours. Additionally, call hold times were compared, highlighting GuardianVets' efficiency against industry standards. Recognizing the limitations of traditional retention metrics, the study reframed retention as value-added to veterinary practices, similar to customer satisfaction. Future research will focus on tracking long-term engagement trends between clinics that use GuardianVets and those that do not, providing deeper insights into its impact on client retention and practice growth.\nAdditional Segmentation Metrics \nAdditional segmentation metrics include analyzing call types to differentiate between administrative inquiries and urgent concerns, tracking client engagement patterns over time, and comparing retention trends between clinics using GuardianVets and those that do not.\n\n\nConcluding Remarks \n\n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u0003\n\n\u0003\n\u0003\n",

These binary responses simplify the comparison between pre-implementation and post-implementation performance, allowing clinics to quickly grasp the tangible benefits of using GuardianVets. This directly marketable number not only reinforces the value proposition of improved customer satisfaction but also serves as a compelling testimonial for prospective clients seeking to enhance their operational efficiency and overall service quality.",

For every key metric—such as Call Conversion Rate, Average Transaction Size, Customer Satisfaction Scores, Recruitment and Training Costs, Employee Salary Savings, and Client Retention Rate—we present a detailed breakdown that includes four critical components. First, the Results subsection delivers the raw data and key performance indicators, offering a clear picture of how each benefit manifests in real-world settings. Next, the Methodology subsection explains the data collection and analytical techniques used, ensuring transparency and reproducibility in our approach. The Marketing Narratives provide context by translating these numbers into compelling stories that underscore GuardianVets' impact on operational efficiency and customer experience, making the data directly relevant to veterinary clinics. Finally, the Additional Segmentation Metrics offer deeper insights, segmenting data by factors such as service type, hospital size, or geographic location to reveal nuanced trends and opportunities for further optimization. This multi-layered structure not only highlights the measurable benefits of GuardianVets but also equips stakeholders with the insights necessary to drive improved performance and growth.",

        "text": "This paper is structured to provide a deep dive into the tangible benefits of GuardianVets, with each benefit analyzed through multiple complementary lenses. For every key metric—such as Call Conversion Rate, Average Transaction Size, Customer Satisfaction Scores, Recruitment and Training Costs, Employee Salary Savings, and Client Retention Rate—we present a detailed breakdown that includes four critical components. First, the Results subsection delivers the raw data and key performance indicators, offering a clear picture of how each benefit manifests in real-world settings. Next, the Methodology subsection explains the data collection and analytical techniques used, ensuring transparency and reproducibility in our approach. The Marketing Narratives provide context by translating these numbers into compelling stories that underscore GuardianVets' impact on operational efficiency and customer experience, making the data directly relevant to veterinary clinics. Finally, the Additional Segmentation Metrics offer deeper insights, segmenting data by factors such as service type, hospital size, or geographic location to reveal nuanced trends and opportunities for further optimization. This multi-layered structure not only highlights the measurable benefits of GuardianVets but also equips stakeholders with the insights necessary to drive improved performance and growth., OTCRsstatistics that were derivedNext, The Marketing Narratives provide context by translating these numbers into compelling stories that underscore GuardianVets' impact on operational efficiency and customer experience, making the data directly relevant to veterinary clinics.

For every key metric, OTCR presents a detailed breakdown that includes four critical components. First, the Results subsection delivers the raw statistics that were derived, offering a clear picture of how each benefit manifests in real-world settings. Next, The Marketing Narratives provide context by translating these numbers into compelling stories that underscore GuardianVets' impact on customer experience, making the data directly relevant to veterinary clinics. The Methodology subsection explains the data collection and analytical techniques used, ensuring transparency and reproducibility in our approach. Finally, the Additional Segmentation Metrics provide deeper insights by identifying new data opportunities and explaining how this information can enhance the underlying statistics.\n\nTangible Benefit Analysis \n\nCall Conversion Rate\nResults\nMobile Veterinary Services exhibit the highest conversion rate at 26.43%, suggesting that clients seeking mobile services are more likely to commit to an appointment once they make an inquiry. Emergency and Specialty services follow with a 6.78% conversion rate, reflecting the urgent nature of cases that often require immediate medical attention. In contrast, General Practice and standalone Emergency services demonstrate lower conversion rates at 2.66% and 2.43%, respectively, indicating potential inefficiencies or client hesitancy in scheduling appointments after an initial call. Conversion rates vary significantly across veterinary services, emphasizing the need for tailored client engagement to improve appointment scheduling efficiency.\nSource: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/138O2hoyIlJBsnt1MMmv_GEOSGx2Jjdu_#scrollTo=e6890987\nMarketing Narrative\nCall management is a major cost center for veterinary hospitals, yet often overlooked. GuardianVets doesn’t just handle overflow—it transforms how clinics manage client inquiries, reducing costs and inefficiencies.\nHiring a veterinary receptionist costs $1,633 per hire, agency recruitment jumps to $5,250, and training adds another $1,250. With high turnover, these costs add up fast. Meanwhile, GuardianVets handles around 800,000 calls annually, but CSRs can only handle around 195,000. Each call takes time away from patient care.\nBy automating client communication, GuardianVets minimizes hiring costs, optimizes staff efficiency, and ensures hospitals focus on patient care and growth—not administrative burden. Instead of just improving client engagement, GuardianVets is a financial and staffing solution that directly impacts profitability.\nMethodology\nTo calculate the Call-to-Appointment Conversion Rate (CACR), data was first extracted from Power BI, which included records of incoming calls and scheduled appointments categorized by service type: Emergency, Emergency & Specialty, General Practice, and Mobile Veterinary Services. The data was then filtered to remove incomplete, irrelevant, or duplicate records before being exported into a structured CSV format for further processing.\nFollowing data collection, a data cleaning and preprocessing phase was conducted to ensure accuracy and consistency. All missing or incomplete records were eliminated to prevent skewed analysis. Datasets from different veterinary service categories were merged into a unified DataFrame, creating a standardized dataset that allowed for cross-comparisons.\nThe Call-to-Appointment Conversion Rate was determined using the formula: (Total Appointments by specialty / Total Calls by specialty) x 100. This calculation provided a percentage-based measurement of how effectively each service type converted inquiries into scheduled appointments.\nTo validate and analyze the results, several statistical measures were applied. Descriptive statistics, including mean, median, and standard deviation, were calculated to assess trends and variations in conversion rates across service types. A seaborn boxplot was generated to visualize distribution patterns and detect potential outliers in the dataset. Additionally, a Kruskal-Wallis H-test was performed to determine whether the differences in conversion rates among the various veterinary service categories were statistically significant.\nAdditional Segmentation Metrics \nSeveral clinic-specific factors were identified that could impact conversion rates. Larger clinics with more veterinarians and front desk staff tend to manage higher call volumes, which may influence appointment scheduling efficiency. The range of services offered also plays a role, as clinics providing specialized care, emergency procedures, or telemedicine consultations often experience higher or more unpredictable call volumes. Clinics that operate 24/7 or offer weekend availability see increased inquiries, particularly for emergency cases. Call response time is another crucial factor, as quicker responses to client inquiries improve scheduling rates and overall retention.\nGeographic location also affects call-to-appointment conversion rates. Urban clinics generally receive higher call volumes due to larger pet populations and greater accessibility, while rural clinics may experience surges in emergency inquiries, particularly in regions with limited veterinary alternatives. Seasonal and regional health concerns, such as flea infestations or pet anxiety during holiday travel, also contribute to fluctuating call activity.\n\n\nAverage Transaction Size\nResults\nAverage Transaction Size (ATS) is a key financial metric used to evaluate revenue efficiency per client interaction. By analyzing ATS across different veterinary hospital specialties—Emergency, Emergency & Specialty, General Practice, and Mobile Services—this research identifies revenue generation patterns and operational efficiency. The ATS for each category is calculated as follows: Emergency hospitals have an ATS of $48.08 per call, while Emergency & Specialty hospitals have the highest ATS at $62.71 per call. General Practice hospitals show the lowest ATS at $2.32 per call, indicating lower revenue per client interaction. Mobile Services maintain a moderate ATS of $23.49 per call, suggesting a balance between accessibility and revenue efficiency.\n\nSource: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fApbPN6WSYeMfo8Hm1aqcvXX3JbO66Os#scrollTo=d825765a\nMarketing Narrative\nAverage Transaction Size (ATS) is a key metric for veterinary hospitals to demonstrate the value of their services. GuardianVets helps hospitals optimize client communication by improving appointment scheduling and reducing missed opportunities, ultimately leading to higher ATS and increased revenue.\nHospitals with higher ATS often provide advanced diagnostics, specialized treatments, and expert care, but inefficiencies in client communication can lead to missed appointments and a failure to fully convey this value. For example, an Emergency & Specialty hospital with a high ATS can market this as covering premium services—but this value can be missed if the client is unable to schedule appointments or understand the full scope of care offered.\nGuardianVets not only streamlines call management but also supports transparency in communication. By ensuring clients clearly understand what their payments cover—from diagnostic tests to imaging and treatment plans—GuardianVets enhances trust and clarity in the value of services. This improves client retention, optimizes ATS, and drives long-term profitability, all while reinforcing a hospital's commitment to clear and honest communication.\nMethodology\nThe ATS analysis was conducted through multiple stages, including data cleaning, preprocessing, revenue computation, and segmentation. The data from the four veterinary specialties were imported and merged into a single DataFrame for uniform analysis. Any missing data in the Appointments or Total Calls columns were removed using the dropna() function to ensure accurate revenue calculations. Attendance rates were mapped to each hospital specialty using predefined industry averages. These rates were applied using the .map() function, allowing for precise adjustments in revenue estimates. The attendance rates used were 95% for Emergency hospitals, 93% for Emergency & Specialty hospitals, 89% for General Practice hospitals, and 89% for Mobile Services. (Source: https://www.vetport.com/Tackling-No-Show-At-Veterinary-Practice, https://www.vetport.com/Tackling-No-Show-At-Veterinary-Practice, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11231932/, https://www.veterinarypracticenews.com/handling-late-no-show-clients/) Data type conversions ensured numerical accuracy, formatting all relevant fields as floats or integers using the .astype() function. This preprocessing step prepared the dataset for mathematical operations.\nThe number of actual appointments kept was estimated using the formula Appointments Kept = Appointments × Attendance Rate. This calculation was performed using vectorized operations in pandas, allowing efficient processing of thousands of data entries. Incremental Revenue was then calculated using the formula Incremental Revenue = Appointments Kept × Revenue per Appointment. The revenue per appointment was assigned based on specialty, with Emergency hospitals averaging $2125 per appointment, Emergency & Specialty hospitals at $1000, General Practice hospitals at $100, and Mobile Services at $100. (Source: Costs of Emergency Veterinary Care: What to Know, How Much Does a Vet Visit Cost? Average Pricing By Procedure, How Much Does a Vet Visit Cost? Average Pricing By Procedure, Mobile Vet Care Costs and Pricing Comparison | The Vets) A lambda function applied these revenue rates dynamically across the dataset.\nThe final ATS values were derived using the formula ATS = Incremental Revenue / Total Calls. To prevent errors such as division by zero, np.where() was used to replace missing or zero values with NaN before computing the ratio. Once ATS was computed, the dataset was grouped by Hospital Specialty to analyze performance variations. A box plot generated using the seaborn library, and summary statistics segmented by specialty provided insights into high-revenue categories and potential areas for improvement.\nAdditional Segmentation Metrics \n\nBeyond specialty-based ATS, further segmentation opportunities include client type segmentation, service type impact, and time-based analysis. Client type segmentation involves differentiating ATS between new and returning clients to assess loyalty-driven revenue patterns. Service type impact focuses on comparing ATS for diagnostics, surgical treatments, and preventative care to identify the most profitable services. Time-based analysis examines ATS variations between peak and off-peak hours to optimize pricing strategies and staff allocation. By using segmentation metrics, GuardianVets helps veterinary hospitals optimize client communication and scheduling, highlighting the value of their services. With better call management and transparency, hospitals can demonstrate the full value of treatments, improve client trust, and ultimately maximize profitability across different service areas.",

For every key metric, OTCR presents a detailed breakdown that includes four critical components. First, the Results subsection delivers the raw statistics that were derived, offering a clear picture of how each benefit manifests in real-world settings. Next, The Marketing Narratives provide context by translating these numbers into compelling stories that underscore GuardianVets' impact on customer experience, making the data directly relevant to veterinary clinics. The Methodology subsection explains the data collection and analytical techniques used, ensuring transparency and reproducibility in our approach. Finally, the Additional Segmentation Metrics provide deeper insights by identifying new data opportunities and explaining how this information can enhance the underlying statistics.\n\nTangible Benefit Analysis \n\nCall Conversion Rate\nResults\nMobile Veterinary Services exhibit the highest conversion rate at 26.43%, suggesting that clients seeking mobile services are more likely to commit to an appointment once they make an inquiry. Emergency and Specialty services follow with a 6.78% conversion rate, reflecting the urgent nature of cases that often require immediate medical attention. In contrast, General Practice and standalone Emergency services demonstrate lower conversion rates at 2.66% and 2.43%, respectively, indicating potential inefficiencies or client hesitancy in scheduling appointments after an initial call. Conversion rates vary significantly across veterinary services, emphasizing the need for tailored client engagement to improve appointment scheduling efficiency.\nSource: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/138O2hoyIlJBsnt1MMmv_GEOSGx2Jjdu_#scrollTo=e6890987\nMarketing Narrative\nCall management is a major cost center for veterinary hospitals, yet often overlooked. GuardianVets doesn’t just handle overflow—it transforms how clinics manage client inquiries, reducing costs and inefficiencies.\nHiring a veterinary receptionist costs $1,633 per hire, agency recruitment jumps to $5,250, and training adds another $1,250. With high turnover, these costs add up fast. Meanwhile, GuardianVets handles around 800,000 calls annually, but CSRs can only handle around 195,000. Each call takes time away from patient care.\nBy automating client communication, GuardianVets minimizes hiring costs, optimizes staff efficiency, and ensures hospitals focus on patient care and growth—not administrative burden. Instead of just improving client engagement, GuardianVets is a financial and staffing solution that directly impacts profitability.\nMethodology\nTo calculate the Call-to-Appointment Conversion Rate (CACR), data was first extracted from Power BI, which included records of incoming calls and scheduled appointments categorized by service type: Emergency, Emergency & Specialty, General Practice, and Mobile Veterinary Services. The data was then filtered to remove incomplete, irrelevant, or duplicate records before being exported into a structured CSV format for further processing.\nFollowing data collection, a data cleaning and preprocessing phase was conducted to ensure accuracy and consistency. All missing or incomplete records were eliminated to prevent skewed analysis. Datasets from different veterinary service categories were merged into a unified DataFrame, creating a standardized dataset that allowed for cross-comparisons.\nThe Call-to-Appointment Conversion Rate was determined using the formula: (Total Appointments by specialty / Total Calls by specialty) x 100. This calculation provided a percentage-based measurement of how effectively each service type converted inquiries into scheduled appointments.\nTo validate and analyze the results, several statistical measures were applied. Descriptive statistics, including mean, median, and standard deviation, were calculated to assess trends and variations in conversion rates across service types. A seaborn boxplot was generated to visualize distribution patterns and detect potential outliers in the dataset. Additionally, a Kruskal-Wallis H-test was performed to determine whether the differences in conversion rates among the various veterinary service categories were statistically significant.\nAdditional Segmentation Metrics \nSeveral clinic-specific factors were identified that could impact conversion rates. Larger clinics with more veterinarians and front desk staff tend to manage higher call volumes, which may influence appointment scheduling efficiency. The range of services offered also plays a role, as clinics providing specialized care, emergency procedures, or telemedicine consultations often experience higher or more unpredictable call volumes. Clinics that operate 24/7 or offer weekend availability see increased inquiries, particularly for emergency cases. Call response time is another crucial factor, as quicker responses to client inquiries improve scheduling rates and overall retention.\nGeographic location also affects call-to-appointment conversion rates. Urban clinics generally receive higher call volumes due to larger pet populations and greater accessibility, while rural clinics may experience surges in emergency inquiries, particularly in regions with limited veterinary alternatives. Seasonal and regional health concerns, such as flea infestations or pet anxiety during holiday travel, also contribute to fluctuating call activity.\n\n\nAverage Transaction Size\nResults\nAverage Transaction Size (ATS) is a key financial metric used to evaluate revenue efficiency per client interaction. By analyzing ATS across different veterinary hospital specialties—Emergency, Emergency & Specialty, General Practice, and Mobile Services—this research identifies revenue generation patterns and operational efficiency. The ATS for each category is calculated as follows: Emergency hospitals have an ATS of $48.08 per call, while Emergency & Specialty hospitals have the highest ATS at $62.71 per call. General Practice hospitals show the lowest ATS at $2.32 per call, indicating lower revenue per client interaction. Mobile Services maintain a moderate ATS of $23.49 per call, suggesting a balance between accessibility and revenue efficiency.\n\nSource: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fApbPN6WSYeMfo8Hm1aqcvXX3JbO66Os#scrollTo=d825765a\nMarketing Narrative\nAverage Transaction Size (ATS) is a key metric for veterinary hospitals to demonstrate the value of their services. GuardianVets helps hospitals optimize client communication by improving appointment scheduling and reducing missed opportunities, ultimately leading to higher ATS and increased revenue.\nHospitals with higher ATS often provide advanced diagnostics, specialized treatments, and expert care, but inefficiencies in client communication can lead to missed appointments and a failure to fully convey this value. For example, an Emergency & Specialty hospital with a high ATS can market this as covering premium services—but this value can be missed if the client is unable to schedule appointments or understand the full scope of care offered.\nGuardianVets not only streamlines call management but also supports transparency in communication. By ensuring clients clearly understand what their payments cover—from diagnostic tests to imaging and treatment plans—GuardianVets enhances trust and clarity in the value of services. This improves client retention, optimizes ATS, and drives long-term profitability, all while reinforcing a hospital's commitment to clear and honest communication.\nMethodology\nThe ATS analysis was conducted through multiple stages, including data cleaning, preprocessing, revenue computation, and segmentation. The data from the four veterinary specialties were imported and merged into a single DataFrame for uniform analysis. Any missing data in the Appointments or Total Calls columns were removed using the dropna() function to ensure accurate revenue calculations. Attendance rates were mapped to each hospital specialty using predefined industry averages. These rates were applied using the .map() function, allowing for precise adjustments in revenue estimates. The attendance rates used were 95% for Emergency hospitals, 93% for Emergency & Specialty hospitals, 89% for General Practice hospitals, and 89% for Mobile Services.

        "text": "Assumptions\n\nTo make assumptions about salaries and hiring costs for veterinary receptionists, we relied on industry standards and recruitment data. According to available figures, the average cost to hire a General Veterinary Receptionist is $1,633. However, using a recruitment agency significantly increases costs, ranging from $5,250 to $8,750 per hire. Posting a job on a job board costs approximately $193 per listing, which is a more budget-friendly option. Additionally, training expenses vary, with online training costing $800 per new hire, while in-house training costs around $1,250 per new hire. These figures provide a clear benchmark for estimating the overall investment in hiring and training veterinary receptionists.\n\nPower BI Data\n\nWe derived these call volume figures using Power BI, analyzing data from our call management system to categorize and quantify total interactions, and assess hiring needs based on call volumes. The data revealed that Certified Veterinary Technicians (CVTs) handled approximately 866,000 calls, while Client Service Representatives (CSRs) managed around 195,000 calls. These figures were extracted by filtering call logs based on employee roles and call activity records. In total, the system logged 4 million calls, which includes all veterinary-related inquiries, scheduling requests, and client communications across various roles. By leveraging Power BI's data visualization and reporting tools, we ensured accurate aggregation and segmentation of call volumes for a comprehensive understanding of workload distribution. These statistics can also be used to visualize hiring needs different clinics with differing sizes and receptionist numbers can have.\n\nSegmentation\n\nTo segment hospitals by size, we used call volume data and staffing levels, categorizing them into large, medium, and small hospitals. A large hospital, such as Community Veterinary Medicine, handled 6,923 calls in 2024 and required five receptionists to manage the workload efficiently. A medium-sized hospital, like Newton Animal Clinic, processed 1,160 calls with one receptionist. Meanwhile, a small hospital, such as Best Pets Veterinary Hospital, had 106 calls recorded and operates with one dedicated receptionist.\n\nAdditional Segmentation Metrics \n\nIn the future, we’d like to segment hospital sizes using more accurate data- if there’s any specific data as to how many receptionists big, medium, and small clinics have, as well as the amount of calls they’d receive per day, it’d make our numbers more accurate.",

For every key metric, OTCR presents a detailed breakdown that includes four critical components. First, the Results subsection delivers the raw statistics that were derived, offering a clear picture of how each benefit manifests in real-world settings. Next, The Marketing Narratives provide context by translating these numbers into compelling stories that underscore GuardianVets' impact on customer experience, making the data directly relevant to veterinary clinics. The Methodology subsection explains the data collection and analytical techniques used, ensuring transparency and reproducibility in our approach. Finally, the Additional Segmentation Metrics provide deeper insights by identifying new data opportunities and explaining how this information can enhance the underlying statistics.\n\nTangible Benefit Analysis \n\nCall Conversion Rate\nResults\nMobile Veterinary Services exhibit the highest conversion rate at 26.43%, suggesting that clients seeking mobile services are more likely to commit to an appointment once they make an inquiry. Emergency and Specialty services follow with a 6.78% conversion rate, reflecting the urgent nature of cases that often require immediate medical attention. In contrast, General Practice and standalone Emergency services demonstrate lower conversion rates at 2.66% and 2.43%, respectively, indicating potential inefficiencies or client hesitancy in scheduling appointments after an initial call. Conversion rates vary significantly across veterinary services, emphasizing the need for tailored client engagement to improve appointment scheduling efficiency.\nSource: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/138O2hoyIlJBsnt1MMmv_GEOSGx2Jjdu_#scrollTo=e6890987\nMarketing Narrative\nCall management is a major cost center for veterinary hospitals, yet often overlooked. GuardianVets doesn’t just handle overflow—it transforms how clinics manage client inquiries, reducing costs and inefficiencies.\nHiring a veterinary receptionist costs $1,633 per hire, agency recruitment jumps to $5,250, and training adds another $1,250. With high turnover, these costs add up fast. Meanwhile, GuardianVets handles around 800,000 calls annually, but CSRs can only handle around 195,000. Each call takes time away from patient care.\nBy automating client communication, GuardianVets minimizes hiring costs, optimizes staff efficiency, and ensures hospitals focus on patient care and growth—not administrative burden. Instead of just improving client engagement, GuardianVets is a financial and staffing solution that directly impacts profitability.\nMethodology\nTo calculate the Call-to-Appointment Conversion Rate (CACR), data was first extracted from Power BI, which included records of incoming calls and scheduled appointments categorized by service type: Emergency, Emergency & Specialty, General Practice, and Mobile Veterinary Services. The data was then filtered to remove incomplete, irrelevant, or duplicate records before being exported into a structured CSV format for further processing.\nFollowing data collection, a data cleaning and preprocessing phase was conducted to ensure accuracy and consistency. All missing or incomplete records were eliminated to prevent skewed analysis. Datasets from different veterinary service categories were merged into a unified DataFrame, creating a standardized dataset that allowed for cross-comparisons.\nThe Call-to-Appointment Conversion Rate was determined using the formula: (Total Appointments by specialty / Total Calls by specialty) x 100. This calculation provided a percentage-based measurement of how effectively each service type converted inquiries into scheduled appointments.\nTo validate and analyze the results, several statistical measures were applied. Descriptive statistics, including mean, median, and standard deviation, were calculated to assess trends and variations in conversion rates across service types. A seaborn boxplot was generated to visualize distribution patterns and detect potential outliers in the dataset. Additionally, a Kruskal-Wallis H-test was performed to determine whether the differences in conversion rates among the various veterinary service categories were statistically significant.\nAdditional Segmentation Metrics \nSeveral clinic-specific factors were identified that could impact conversion rates. Larger clinics with more veterinarians and front desk staff tend to manage higher call volumes, which may influence appointment scheduling efficiency. The range of services offered also plays a role, as clinics providing specialized care, emergency procedures, or telemedicine consultations often experience higher or more unpredictable call volumes. Clinics that operate 24/7 or offer weekend availability see increased inquiries, particularly for emergency cases. Call response time is another crucial factor, as quicker responses to client inquiries improve scheduling rates and overall retention.\nGeographic location also affects call-to-appointment conversion rates. Urban clinics generally receive higher call volumes due to larger pet populations and greater accessibility, while rural clinics may experience surges in emergency inquiries, particularly in regions with limited veterinary alternatives. Seasonal and regional health concerns, such as flea infestations or pet anxiety during holiday travel, also contribute to fluctuating call activity.\n\n\nAverage Transaction Size\nResults\nAverage Transaction Size (ATS) is a key financial metric used to evaluate revenue efficiency per client interaction. By analyzing ATS across different veterinary hospital specialties—Emergency, Emergency & Specialty, General Practice, and Mobile Services—this research identifies revenue generation patterns and operational efficiency. The ATS for each category is calculated as follows: Emergency hospitals have an ATS of $48.08 per call, while Emergency & Specialty hospitals have the highest ATS at $62.71 per call. General Practice hospitals show the lowest ATS at $2.32 per call, indicating lower revenue per client interaction. Mobile Services maintain a moderate ATS of $23.49 per call, suggesting a balance between accessibility and revenue efficiency.\n\nSource: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fApbPN6WSYeMfo8Hm1aqcvXX3JbO66Os#scrollTo=d825765a\nMarketing Narrative\nAverage Transaction Size (ATS) is a key metric for veterinary hospitals to demonstrate the value of their services. GuardianVets helps hospitals optimize client communication by improving appointment scheduling and reducing missed opportunities, ultimately leading to higher ATS and increased revenue.\nHospitals with higher ATS often provide advanced diagnostics, specialized treatments, and expert care, but inefficiencies in client communication can lead to missed appointments and a failure to fully convey this value. For example, an Emergency & Specialty hospital with a high ATS can market this as covering premium services—but this value can be missed if the client is unable to schedule appointments or understand the full scope of care offered.\nGuardianVets not only streamlines call management but also supports transparency in communication. By ensuring clients clearly understand what their payments cover—from diagnostic tests to imaging and treatment plans—GuardianVets enhances trust and clarity in the value of services. This improves client retention, optimizes ATS, and drives long-term profitability, all while reinforcing a hospital's commitment to clear and honest communication.\nMethodology\nThe ATS analysis was conducted through multiple stages, including data cleaning, preprocessing, revenue computation, and segmentation. The data from the four veterinary specialties were imported and merged into a single DataFrame for uniform analysis. Any missing data in the Appointments or Total Calls columns were removed using the dropna() function to ensure accurate revenue calculations. Attendance rates were mapped to each hospital specialty using predefined industry averages. These rates were applied using the .map() function, allowing for precise adjustments in revenue estimates. The attendance rates used were 95% for Emergency hospitals, 93% for Emergency & Specialty hospitals, 89% for General Practice hospitals, and 89% for Mobile Services. (Source: https://www.vetport.com/Tackling-No-Show-At-Veterinary-Practice, https://www.vetport.com/Tackling-No-Show-At-Veterinary-Practice, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11231932/, https://www.veterinarypracticenews.com/handling-late-no-show-clients/) Data type conversions ensured numerical accuracy, formatting all relevant fields as floats or integers using the .astype() function. This preprocessing step prepared the dataset for mathematical operations.\nThe number of actual appointments kept was estimated using the formula Appointments Kept = Appointments × Attendance Rate. This calculation was performed using vectorized operations in pandas, allowing efficient processing of thousands of data entries. Incremental Revenue was then calculated using the formula Incremental Revenue = Appointments Kept × Revenue per Appointment. The revenue per appointment was assigned based on specialty, with Emergency hospitals averaging $2125 per appointment, Emergency & Specialty hospitals at $1000, General Practice hospitals at $100, and Mobile Services at $100. (Source: Costs of Emergency Veterinary Care: What to Know, How Much Does a Vet Visit Cost? Average Pricing By Procedure, How Much Does a Vet Visit Cost? Average Pricing By Procedure, Mobile Vet Care Costs and Pricing Comparison | The Vets) A lambda function applied these revenue rates dynamically across the dataset.\nThe final ATS values were derived using the formula ATS = Incremental Revenue / Total Calls. To prevent errors such as division by zero, np.where() was used to replace missing or zero values with NaN before computing the ratio. Once ATS was computed, the dataset was grouped by Hospital Specialty to analyze performance variations. A box plot generated using the seaborn library, and summary statistics segmented by specialty provided insights into high-revenue categories and potential areas for improvement.\nAdditional Segmentation Metrics \n\nBeyond specialty-based ATS, further segmentation opportunities include client type segmentation, service type impact, and time-based analysis. Client type segmentation involves differentiating ATS between new and returning clients to assess loyalty-driven revenue patterns. Service type impact focuses on comparing ATS for diagnostics, surgical treatments, and preventative care to identify the most profitable services. Time-based analysis examines ATS variations between peak and off-peak hours to optimize pricing strategies and staff allocation. By using segmentation metrics, GuardianVets helps veterinary hospitals optimize client communication and scheduling, highlighting the value of their services. With better call management and transparency, hospitals can demonstrate the full value of treatments, improve client trust, and ultimately maximize profitability across different service areas.\n\n\n",

Conversion rates vary significantly across veterinary services, emphasizing the need for tailored client engagement to improve appointment scheduling efficiency.\nSource: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/138O2hoyIlJBsnt1MMmv_GEOSGx2Jjdu_#scrollTo=e6890987\n\nMarketing Narrative\nCall management is a major cost center for veterinary hospitals, yet often overlooked. GuardianVets doesn’t just handle overflow—it transforms how clinics manage client inquiries, reducing costs and inefficiencies.\nHiring a veterinary receptionist costs $1,633 per hire, agency recruitment jumps to $5,250, and training adds another $1,250. With high turnover, these costs add up fast. Meanwhile, GuardianVets handles around 800,000 calls annually, but CSRs can only handle around 195,000. Each call takes time away from patient care.\nBy automating client communication, GuardianVets minimizes hiring costs, optimizes staff efficiency, and ensures hospitals focus on patient care and growth—not administrative burden. Instead of just improving client engagement, GuardianVets is a financial and staffing solution that directly impacts profitability.\nMethodology\nTo calculate the Call-to-Appointment Conversion Rate (CACR), data was first extracted from Power BI, which included records of incoming calls and scheduled appointments categorized by service type: Emergency, Emergency & Specialty, General Practice, and Mobile Veterinary Services. The data was then filtered to remove incomplete, irrelevant, or duplicate records before being exported into a structured CSV format for further processing.\nFollowing data collection, a data cleaning and preprocessing phase was conducted to ensure accuracy and consistency. All missing or incomplete records were eliminated to prevent skewed analysis. Datasets from different veterinary service categories were merged into a unified DataFrame, creating a standardized dataset that allowed for cross-comparisons.\nThe Call-to-Appointment Conversion Rate was determined using the formula: (Total Appointments by specialty / Total Calls by specialty) x 100. This calculation provided a percentage-based measurement of how effectively each service type converted inquiries into scheduled appointments.\nTo validate and analyze the results, several statistical measures were applied. Descriptive statistics, including mean, median, and standard deviation, were calculated to assess trends and variations in conversion rates across service types. A seaborn boxplot was generated to visualize distribution patterns and detect potential outliers in the dataset. Additionally, a Kruskal-Wallis H-test was performed to determine whether the differences in conversion rates among the various veterinary service categories were statistically significant.\nAdditional Segmentation Metrics \nSeveral clinic-specific factors were identified that could impact conversion rates. Larger clinics with more veterinarians and front desk staff tend to manage higher call volumes, which may influence appointment scheduling efficiency. The range of services offered also plays a role, as clinics providing specialized care, emergency procedures, or telemedicine consultations often experience higher or more unpredictable call volumes. Clinics that operate 24/7 or offer weekend availability see increased inquiries, particularly for emergency cases. Call response time is another crucial factor, as quicker responses to client inquiries improve scheduling rates and overall retention.\nGeographic location also affects call-to-appointment conversion rates. Urban clinics generally receive higher call volumes due to larger pet populations and greater accessibility, while rural clinics may experience surges in emergency inquiries, particularly in regions with limited veterinary alternatives. Seasonal and regional health concerns, such as flea infestations or pet anxiety during holiday travel, also contribute to fluctuating call activity.\n\nAverage Transaction Size\nResults\nAverage Transaction Size (ATS) is a key financial metric used to evaluate revenue efficiency per client interaction. By analyzing ATS across different veterinary hospital specialties—Emergency, Emergency & Specialty, General Practice, and Mobile Services—this research identifies revenue generation patterns and operational efficiency. The ATS for each category is calculated as follows: Emergency hospitals have an ATS of $48.08 per call, while Emergency & Specialty hospitals have the highest ATS at $62.71 per call. General Practice hospitals show the lowest ATS at $2.32 per call, indicating lower revenue per client interaction. Mobile Services maintain a moderate ATS of $23.49 per call, suggesting a balance between accessibility and revenue efficiency.\n\nSource: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fApbPN6WSYeMfo8Hm1aqcvXX3JbO66Os#scrollTo=d825765a\nMarketing Narrative\nAverage Transaction Size (ATS) is a key metric for veterinary hospitals to demonstrate the value of their services. GuardianVets helps hospitals optimize client communication by improving appointment scheduling and reducing missed opportunities, ultimately leading to higher ATS and increased revenue.\nHospitals with higher ATS often provide advanced diagnostics, specialized treatments, and expert care, but inefficiencies in client communication can lead to missed appointments and a failure to fully convey this value. For example, an Emergency & Specialty hospital with a high ATS can market this as covering premium services—but this value can be missed if the client is unable to schedule appointments or understand the full scope of care offered.\nGuardianVets not only streamlines call management but also supports transparency in communication. By ensuring clients clearly understand what their payments cover—from diagnostic tests to imaging and treatment plans—GuardianVets enhances trust and clarity in the value of services. This improves client retention, optimizes ATS, and drives long-term profitability, all while reinforcing a hospital's commitment to clear and honest communication.\nMethodology\nThe ATS analysis was conducted through multiple stages, including data cleaning, preprocessing, revenue computation, and segmentation. The data from the four veterinary specialties were imported and merged into a single DataFrame for uniform analysis. Any missing data in the Appointments or Total Calls columns were removed using the dropna() function to ensure accurate revenue calculations. Attendance rates were mapped to each hospital specialty using predefined industry averages. These rates were applied using the .map() function, allowing for precise adjustments in revenue estimates. The attendance rates used were 95% for Emergency hospitals, 93% for Emergency & Specialty hospitals, 89% for General Practice hospitals, and 89% for Mobile Services.

This preprocessing step prepared the dataset for mathematical operations.\nThe number of actual appointments kept was estimated using the formula Appointments Kept = Appointments × Attendance Rate. This calculation was performed using vectorized operations in pandas, allowing efficient processing of thousands of data entries. Incremental Revenue was then calculated using the formula Incremental Revenue = Appointments Kept × Revenue per Appointment. The revenue per appointment was assigned based on specialty, with Emergency hospitals averaging $2125 per appointment, Emergency & Specialty hospitals at $1000, General Practice hospitals at $100, and Mobile Services at $100. (Source: Costs of Emergency Veterinary Care: What to Know, How Much Does a Vet Visit Cost? Average Pricing By Procedure, How Much Does a Vet Visit Cost? Average Pricing By Procedure, Mobile Vet Care Costs and Pricing Comparison | The Vets) A lambda function applied these revenue rates dynamically across the dataset.\nThe final ATS values were derived using the formula ATS = Incremental Revenue / Total Calls. To prevent errors such as division by zero, np.where() was used to replace missing or zero values with NaN before computing the ratio. Once ATS was computed, the dataset was grouped by Hospital Specialty to analyze performance variations. A boxplot generated using the seaborn library, and summary statistics segmented by specialty provided insights into high-revenue categories and potential areas for improvement.\nAdditional Segmentation Metrics \n\nBeyond specialty-based ATS, further segmentation opportunities include client type segmentation, service type impact, and time-based analysis. Client type segmentation involves differentiating ATS between new and returning clients to assess loyalty-driven revenue patterns. Service type impact focuses on comparing ATS for diagnostics, surgical treatments, and preventative care to identify the most profitable services. Time-based analysis examines ATS variations between peak and off-peak hours to optimize pricing strategies and staff allocation. By using segmentation metrics, GuardianVets helps veterinary hospitals optimize client communication and scheduling, highlighting the value of their services. With better call management and transparency, hospitals can demonstrate the full value of treatments, improve client trust, and ultimately maximize profitability across different service areas.\n\n\nCustomer Satisfaction Scores\nResults\nMarketing Narrative\nMethodology\nAdditional Segmentation Metrics \n\nRecruitment and Training Costs \nResults\nRecruitment and training costs play a big role in veterinary clinic spending throughout a clinic’s lifetime. On average, they spend between $10,000 and $25,000 on recruitment, and more specific numbers can be found in the methodology section of this metric. In addition, our Power BI data was used to assess hiring needs based on call volumes, with CVT’s handling 866,000 total calls in a year, and CSR’s handling 195,000 total calls in a year. Finally, our segmentation further displayed the amount of calls and receptionists hospitals segmented by size(small, medium, large), receive, and all of these statistics are used to paint a coherent picture about both the true possible impact of GuardianVets, and how this can be spun using a marketing narrative standpoint.\n\nMarketing Narrative\nCall volume takes up so much of a part of veterinary clinic’s proceedings- GuardianVets essentially automating this service saves both recruitment time and funds. A general veterinary receptionist costs about $1,633/hire, a vet-receptionist from a recruitment agency costs about $5,250/hire, a job posting from a clinic costs about $200/hire, and it’s $1,250 for in-house training.  \n\nIn addition, according to our Power BI Data, veterinary clinics have certain statistics showing just how exorbitant call volumes can become- CVT’s(Certified Veterinary Technicians) get around 866,000 total calls in a year, with CSR(Client Service Representatives) getting around 195,000 total calls in a year. Clinics themselves get around 4 million calls in a year handled through the org. Automating this process with GuardianVets speaks for itself, based simply on the call volumes it’d essentially nullify.\n\nWith the exorbitant numbers training costs can reach, and the amount GuardianVets can save, the choice to choose GuardianVets is obvious. \nMethodology\n\nAssumptions\n\nTo make assumptions about salaries and hiring costs for veterinary receptionists, we relied on industry standards and recruitment data. According to available figures, the average cost to hire a General Veterinary Receptionist is $1,633. However, using a recruitment agency significantly increases costs, ranging from $5,250 to $8,750 per hire. Posting a job on a job board costs approximately $193 per listing, which is a more budget-friendly option. Additionally, training expenses vary, with online training costing $800 per new hire, while in-house training costs around $1,250 per new hire. These figures provide a clear benchmark for estimating the overall investment in hiring and training veterinary receptionists.\n\nPower BI Data\n\nWe derived these call volume figures using Power BI, analyzing data from our call management system to categorize and quantify total interactions, and assess hiring needs based on call volumes. The data revealed that Certified Veterinary Technicians (CVTs) handled approximately 866,000 calls, while Client Service Representatives (CSRs) managed around 195,000 calls. These figures were extracted by filtering call logs based on employee roles and call activity records. In total, the system logged 4 million calls, which includes all veterinary-related inquiries, scheduling requests, and client communications across various roles. By leveraging Power BI's data visualization and reporting tools, we ensured accurate aggregation and segmentation of call volumes for a comprehensive understanding of workload distribution. These statistics can also be used to visualize hiring needs different clinics with differing sizes and receptionist numbers can have.\n\nSegmentation\n\nTo segment hospitals by size, we used call volume data and staffing levels, categorizing them into large, medium, and small hospitals. A large hospital, such as Community Veterinary Medicine, handled 6,923 calls in 2024 and required five receptionists to manage the workload efficiently. A medium-sized hospital, like Newton Animal Clinic, processed 1,160 calls with one receptionist. Meanwhile, a small hospital, such as Best Pets Veterinary Hospital, had 106 calls recorded and operates with one dedicated receptionist.\n\nAdditional Segmentation Metrics \n\nIn the future, we’d like to segment hospital sizes using more accurate data- if there’s any specific data as to how many receptionists big, medium, and small clinics have, as well as the amount of calls they’d receive per day, it’d make our numbers more accurate.\n\n\nEmployee Salary Savings \nTo quantify salary savings, we analyzed the time veterinarians and customer service (CS) agents save by offloading phone call handling. On average, veterinarians save 252.81 minutes per day, allowing them to dedicate more time to patient care. Customer service agents also reduce their workload significantly, particularly in handling appointment bookings.\nResults\n\nOur analysis of hospital call management shows that total call durations range from approximately 180,000 to over 500,000 minutes annually per hospital. Emergency calls, follow-ups, and consultations handled by veterinarians contribute significantly to workload. Depending on the hospital, veterinarians save between 56 and 182 minutes per day, while CS agents save between 84 and 274 minutes daily. These efficiency gains reduce opportunity costs, allowing medical professionals to focus on patient care rather than administrative tasks.\n\nMarketing Narrative\nVeterinary hospitals deal with a constant flow of calls, from appointment bookings to emergency consultations, which take up a significant amount of time for both veterinarians and customer service agents. By shifting call management away from veterinarians, hospitals can free up valuable hours that would otherwise be spent on the phone. This allows vets to focus on what matters most—treating patients—while also improving overall efficiency.\nReducing call-handling time doesn’t just help veterinarians; it also enhances the customer experience. Clients get faster responses without long hold times, leading to better service and satisfaction. At the same time, employees face less stress from constantly managing calls, reducing burnout and improving job retention.\nFor hospitals, this solution is an easy way to optimize operations without adding more staff. With better time management, hospitals can take on more patients, increase revenue, and ensure their team works at full capacity in the most effective way possible.\nMethodology\nTo estimate opportunity cost savings, we categorized incoming hospital calls into four types: appointment bookings, consultations, emergency calls, and follow-ups. Each category was assigned a handling time based on industry norms and hospital workflows. Appointment bookings, which constituted 60% of total calls, had an estimated handling time of 2 to 5 minutes per call and were handled exclusively by customer service agents. Consultations, making up 20% of calls, took between 10 and 15 minutes per call and were managed by veterinarians. Emergency calls accounted for 10% of calls, requiring between 15 and 30 minutes per call, while follow-up calls made up another 10%, with an average duration of 5 to 10 minutes. Both emergency and follow-up calls were handled entirely by veterinarians.\nUsing this distribution, we calculated the total time spent on each call category per hospital by applying the corresponding percentages to the hospital's total call duration data. For example, if a hospital had a total call duration of 400,000 minutes annually, approximately 240,000 minutes were spent on appointment bookings, 80,000 minutes on consultations, 40,000 minutes on emergency calls, and 40,000 minutes on follow-ups.\nSince appointment bookings were handled solely by customer service agents, we calculated their total work hours spent on calls separately. For veterinarians, we aggregated the minutes spent on consultations, emergency calls, and follow-ups to determine their total time allocated to phone handling. The estimated time savings for each hospital was calculated based on the assumption that veterinarians no longer handle any phone calls, allowing them to allocate this recovered time to patient care.\nTo determine the daily time saved per veterinarian, we divided the total saved minutes by 5 (years) * 260 (working days), assuming consistent call volumes throughout the year. Individual hospital time savings ranged from 56 to 182 minutes per day for veterinarians, while CS agents saved between 84 and 274 minutes daily.\nAssumptions\nThis analysis relies on the following assumptions:\nThe call distribution percentages—60% appointment bookings, 20% consultations, 10% emergency calls, and 10% follow-ups—are estimates due to the absence of categorized call data.\nEach veterinarian and customer service agent operates at full efficiency within their respective call handling roles.\nThe five-year cost savings projection assumes a constant call volume over time.\nAppointment bookings are managed entirely by customer service agents, while veterinarians handle all other call types.\nIn this model, veterinarians are assumed to be fully dedicated to phone call management during work hours, with no in-person patient interactions included in their workload.\nAdditional Segmentation Metrics \nThis analysis can be further segmented to refine insights and account for variations across hospitals. One way to segment is by hospital size, since larger hospitals with higher call volumes tend to see greater cumulative time savings. A second approach is by call distribution, where hospitals with a higher percentage of consultations and emergency calls benefit more from offloading calls, as these require longer handling times.\nGeographical location also plays a role, since regions with higher labor costs will experience greater financial savings from time efficiencies. Another way to segment is by the ratio of veterinarians to customer service agents. Hospitals where veterinarians handle a disproportionate share of calls see the highest impact from offloading phone work, whereas hospitals with a more balanced distribution may experience different efficiency dynamics.\nClient Retention Rate \nResults\nLast semester’s analysis found that 37.46% of customers would have called another clinic if GuardianVets wasn’t available, highlighting its role in retention. Additionally, 95% of clients want their vet to keep GuardianVets, reinforcing its value as a “luxury” service. With an average hold time of 2.5 minutes—compared to the industry’s 4.4 minutes—GuardianVets enhances accessibility and client experience. While traditional retention metrics fall short, tracking long-term engagement trends between clinics using GuardianVets and those that don’t can further validate its impact on client retention and practice growth.\nMarketing Narrative\nGuardianVets strengthens the bond between veterinarians and their clients by ensuring accessible, high-quality after-hours support. With 95% of customers valuing the service and faster response times than industry standards, it enhances client satisfaction and loyalty. By positioning GuardianVets as a premium, must-have service, clinics can differentiate themselves and drive long-term retention.\nMethodology\nThe methodology involved collecting and analyzing survey data to gauge client retention and satisfaction with GuardianVets. The team examined customer responses to the “what would you have done” question, segmenting data to determine how many clients would have called another clinic versus waiting for business hours. Additionally, call hold times were compared, highlighting GuardianVets' efficiency against industry standards. Recognizing the limitations of traditional retention metrics, the study reframed retention as value-added to veterinary practices, similar to customer satisfaction. Future research will focus on tracking long-term engagement trends between clinics that use GuardianVets and those that do not, providing deeper insights into its impact on client retention and practice growth.\nAdditional Segmentation Metrics \nAdditional segmentation metrics include analyzing call types to differentiate between administrative inquiries and urgent concerns, tracking client engagement patterns over time, and comparing retention trends between clinics using GuardianVets and those that do not.\n\n\nConcluding Remarks \n\n",

These statistics can also be used to visualize hiring needs different clinics with differing sizes and receptionist numbers can have.\n\nSegmentation\n\nTo segment hospitals by size, we used call volume data and staffing levels, categorizing them into large, medium, and small hospitals. A large hospital, such as Community Veterinary Medicine, handled 6,923 calls in 2024 and required five receptionists to manage the workload efficiently. A medium-sized hospital, like Newton Animal Clinic, processed 1,160 calls with one receptionist. Meanwhile, a small hospital, such as Best Pets Veterinary Hospital, had 106 calls recorded and operates with one dedicated receptionist.\n\nAdditional Segmentation Metrics \n\nIn the future, we’d like to segment hospital sizes using more accurate data- if there’s any specific data as to how many receptionists big, medium, and small clinics have, as well as the amount of calls they’d receive per day, it’d make our numbers more accurate.\n\n\nEmployee Salary Savings \nTo quantify salary savings, we analyzed the time veterinarians and customer service (CS) agents save by offloading phone call handling. On average, veterinarians save 252.81 minutes per day, allowing them to dedicate more time to patient care. Customer service agents also reduce their workload significantly, particularly in handling appointment bookings.\nResults\n\nOur analysis of hospital call management shows that total call durations range from approximately 180,000 to over 500,000 minutes annually per hospital. Emergency calls, follow-ups, and consultations handled by veterinarians contribute significantly to workload. Depending on the hospital, veterinarians save between 56 and 182 minutes per day, while CS agents save between 84 and 274 minutes daily. These efficiency gains reduce opportunity costs, allowing medical professionals to focus on patient care rather than administrative tasks.\n\nMarketing Narrative\nVeterinary hospitals deal with a constant flow of calls, from appointment bookings to emergency consultations, which take up a significant amount of time for both veterinarians and customer service agents. By shifting call management away from veterinarians, hospitals can free up valuable hours that would otherwise be spent on the phone. This allows vets to focus on what matters most—treating patients—while also improving overall efficiency.\nReducing call-handling time doesn’t just help veterinarians; it also enhances the customer experience. Clients get faster responses without long hold times, leading to better service and satisfaction. At the same time, employees face less stress from constantly managing calls, reducing burnout and improving job retention.\nFor hospitals, this solution is an easy way to optimize operations without adding more staff. With better time management, hospitals can take on more patients, increase revenue, and ensure their team works at full capacity in the most effective way possible.\nMethodology\nTo estimate opportunity cost savings, we categorized incoming hospital calls into four types: appointment bookings, consultations, emergency calls, and follow-ups. Each category was assigned a handling time based on industry norms and hospital workflows. Appointment bookings, which constituted 60% of total calls, had an estimated handling time of 2 to 5 minutes per call and were handled exclusively by customer service agents. Consultations, making up 20% of calls, took between 10 and 15 minutes per call and were managed by veterinarians. Emergency calls accounted for 10% of calls, requiring between 15 and 30 minutes per call, while follow-up calls made up another 10%, with an average duration of 5 to 10 minutes. Both emergency and follow-up calls were handled entirely by veterinarians.\nUsing this distribution, we calculated the total time spent on each call category per hospital by applying the corresponding percentages to the hospital's total call duration data. For example, if a hospital had a total call duration of 400,000 minutes annually, approximately 240,000 minutes were spent on appointment bookings, 80,000 minutes on consultations, 40,000 minutes on emergency calls, and 40,000 minutes on follow-ups.\nSince appointment bookings were handled solely by customer service agents, we calculated their total work hours spent on calls separately. For veterinarians, we aggregated the minutes spent on consultations, emergency calls, and follow-ups to determine their total time allocated to phone handling. The estimated time savings for each hospital was calculated based on the assumption that veterinarians no longer handle any phone calls, allowing them to allocate this recovered time to patient care.\nTo determine the daily time saved per veterinarian, we divided the total saved minutes by 5 (years) * 260 (working days), assuming consistent call volumes throughout the year. Individual hospital time savings ranged from 56 to 182 minutes per day for veterinarians, while CS agents saved between 84 and 274 minutes daily.\nAssumptions\nThis analysis relies on the following assumptions:\nThe call distribution percentages—60% appointment bookings, 20% consultations, 10% emergency calls, and 10% follow-ups—are estimates due to the absence of categorized call data.\nEach veterinarian and customer service agent operates at full efficiency within their respective call handling roles.\nThe five-year cost savings projection assumes a constant call volume over time.\nAppointment bookings are managed entirely by customer service agents, while veterinarians handle all other call types.\nIn this model, veterinarians are assumed to be fully dedicated to phone call management during work hours, with no in-person patient interactions included in their workload.\nAdditional Segmentation Metrics \nThis analysis can be further segmented to refine insights and account for variations across hospitals. One way to segment is by hospital size, since larger hospitals with higher call volumes tend to see greater cumulative time savings. A second approach is by call distribution, where hospitals with a higher percentage of consultations and emergency calls benefit more from offloading calls, as these require longer handling times.\nGeographical location also plays a role, since regions with higher labor costs will experience greater financial savings from time efficiencies. Another way to segment is by the ratio of veterinarians to customer service agents. Hospitals where veterinarians handle a disproportionate share of calls see the highest impact from offloading phone work, whereas hospitals with a more balanced distribution may experience different efficiency dynamics.\nClient Retention Rate \nResults\nLast semester’s analysis found that 37.46% of customers would have called another clinic if GuardianVets wasn’t available, highlighting its role in retention. Additionally, 95% of clients want their vet to keep GuardianVets, reinforcing its value as a “luxury” service. With an average hold time of 2.5 minutes—compared to the industry’s 4.4 minutes—GuardianVets enhances accessibility and client experience. While traditional retention metrics fall short, tracking long-term engagement trends between clinics using GuardianVets and those that don’t can further validate its impact on client retention and practice growth.\nMarketing Narrative\nGuardianVets strengthens the bond between veterinarians and their clients by ensuring accessible, high-quality after-hours support. With 95% of customers valuing the service and faster response times than industry standards, it enhances client satisfaction and loyalty. By positioning GuardianVets as a premium, must-have service, clinics can differentiate themselves and drive long-term retention.\nMethodology\nThe methodology involved collecting and analyzing survey data to gauge client retention and satisfaction with GuardianVets. The team examined customer responses to the “what would you have done” question, segmenting data to determine how many clients would have called another clinic versus waiting for business hours. Additionally, call hold times were compared, highlighting GuardianVets' efficiency against industry standards. Recognizing the limitations of traditional retention metrics, the study reframed retention as value-added to veterinary practices, similar to customer satisfaction. Future research will focus on tracking long-term engagement trends between clinics that use GuardianVets and those that do not, providing deeper insights into its impact on client retention and practice growth.\nAdditional Segmentation Metrics \nAdditional segmentation metrics include analyzing call types to differentiate between administrative inquiries and urgent concerns, tracking client engagement patterns over time, and comparing retention trends between clinics using GuardianVets and those that do not.\n\n\nConcluding Remarks \n\n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u0003\n\n\u0003\n\u0003\n",

Your solution reduces stress on employees, helps mitigate burnout, and allows hospitals to operate at full capacity, ultimately boosting revenue and service quality.

For every key metric, OTCR presents a detailed breakdown that includes four critical components. First, the Results subsection delivers the raw statistics that were derived, offering a clear picture of how each benefit manifests in real-world settings. Next, The Marketing Narratives provide context by translating these numbers into compelling stories that underscore GuardianVets' impact on customer experience, making the data directly relevant to veterinary clinics. The Methodology subsection explains the data collection and analytical techniques used, ensuring transparency and reproducibility in our approach. Finally, the Additional Segmentation Metrics provide deeper insights by identifying new data opportunities and explaining how this information can enhance the underlying statistics.\n\nTangible Benefit Analysis \n\nCall Conversion Rate\nResults\nMobile Veterinary Services exhibit the highest conversion rate at 26.43%, suggesting that clients seeking mobile services are more likely to commit to an appointment once they make an inquiry. Emergency and Specialty services follow with a 6.78% conversion rate, reflecting the urgent nature of cases that often require immediate medical attention. In contrast, General Practice and standalone Emergency services demonstrate lower conversion rates at 2.66% and 2.43%, respectively, indicating potential inefficiencies or client hesitancy in scheduling appointments after an initial call. Conversion rates vary significantly across veterinary services, emphasizing the need for tailored client engagement to improve appointment scheduling efficiency.\nSource: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/138O2hoyIlJBsnt1MMmv_GEOSGx2Jjdu_#scrollTo=e6890987\nMarketing Narrative\nCall management is a major cost center for veterinary hospitals, yet often overlooked. GuardianVets doesn’t just handle overflow—it transforms how clinics manage client inquiries, reducing costs and inefficiencies.\nHiring a veterinary receptionist costs $1,633 per hire, agency recruitment jumps to $5,250, and training adds another $1,250. With high turnover, these costs add up fast. Meanwhile, GuardianVets handles around 800,000 calls annually, but CSRs can only handle around 195,000. Each call takes time away from patient care.\nBy automating client communication, GuardianVets minimizes hiring costs, optimizes staff efficiency, and ensures hospitals focus on patient care and growth—not administrative burden. Instead of just improving client engagement, GuardianVets is a financial and staffing solution that directly impacts profitability.\nMethodology\nTo calculate the Call-to-Appointment Conversion Rate (CACR), data was first extracted from Power BI, which included records of incoming calls and scheduled appointments categorized by service type: Emergency, Emergency & Specialty, General Practice, and Mobile Veterinary Services. The data was then filtered to remove incomplete, irrelevant, or duplicate records before being exported into a structured CSV format for further processing.\nFollowing data collection, a data cleaning and preprocessing phase was conducted to ensure accuracy and consistency. All missing or incomplete records were eliminated to prevent skewed analysis. Datasets from different veterinary service categories were merged into a unified DataFrame, creating a standardized dataset that allowed for cross-comparisons.\nThe Call-to-Appointment Conversion Rate was determined using the formula: (Total Appointments by specialty / Total Calls by specialty) x 100. This calculation provided a percentage-based measurement of how effectively each service type converted inquiries into scheduled appointments.\nTo validate and analyze the results, several statistical measures were applied. Descriptive statistics, including mean, median, and standard deviation, were calculated to assess trends and variations in conversion rates across service types. A seaborn boxplot was generated to visualize distribution patterns and detect potential outliers in the dataset. Additionally, a Kruskal-Wallis H-test was performed to determine whether the differences in conversion rates among the various veterinary service categories were statistically significant.\nAdditional Segmentation Metrics \nSeveral clinic-specific factors were identified that could impact conversion rates. Larger clinics with more veterinarians and front desk staff tend to manage higher call volumes, which may influence appointment scheduling efficiency. The range of services offered also plays a role, as clinics providing specialized care, emergency procedures, or telemedicine consultations often experience higher or more unpredictable call volumes. Clinics that operate 24/7 or offer weekend availability see increased inquiries, particularly for emergency cases. Call response time is another crucial factor, as quicker responses to client inquiries improve scheduling rates and overall retention.\nGeographic location also affects call-to-appointment conversion rates. Urban clinics generally receive higher call volumes due to larger pet populations and greater accessibility, while rural clinics may experience surges in emergency inquiries, particularly in regions with limited veterinary alternatives. Seasonal and regional health concerns, such as flea infestations or pet anxiety during holiday travel, also contribute to fluctuating call activity.\n\n\nAverage Transaction Size\nResults\nAverage Transaction Size (ATS) is a key financial metric used to evaluate revenue efficiency per client interaction. By analyzing ATS across different veterinary hospital specialties—Emergency, Emergency & Specialty, General Practice, and Mobile Services—this research identifies revenue generation patterns and operational efficiency. The ATS for each category is calculated as follows: Emergency hospitals have an ATS of $48.08 per call, while Emergency & Specialty hospitals have the highest ATS at $62.71 per call. General Practice hospitals show the lowest ATS at $2.32 per call, indicating lower revenue per client interaction. Mobile Services maintain a moderate ATS of $23.49 per call, suggesting a balance between accessibility and revenue efficiency.\n\nSource: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fApbPN6WSYeMfo8Hm1aqcvXX3JbO66Os#scrollTo=d825765a\nMarketing Narrative\nAverage Transaction Size (ATS) is a key metric for veterinary hospitals to demonstrate the value of their services. GuardianVets helps hospitals optimize client communication by improving appointment scheduling and reducing missed opportunities, ultimately leading to higher ATS and increased revenue.\nHospitals with higher ATS often provide advanced diagnostics, specialized treatments, and expert care, but inefficiencies in client communication can lead to missed appointments and a failure to fully convey this value. For example, an Emergency & Specialty hospital with a high ATS can market this as covering premium services—but this value can be missed if the client is unable to schedule appointments or understand the full scope of care offered.\nGuardianVets not only streamlines call management but also supports transparency in communication. By ensuring clients clearly understand what their payments cover—from diagnostic tests to imaging and treatment plans—GuardianVets enhances trust and clarity in the value of services. This improves client retention, optimizes ATS, and drives long-term profitability, all while reinforcing a hospital's commitment to clear and honest communication.\nMethodology\nThe ATS analysis was conducted through multiple stages, including data cleaning, preprocessing, revenue computation, and segmentation. The data from the four veterinary specialties were imported and merged into a single DataFrame for uniform analysis. Any missing data in the Appointments or Total Calls columns were removed using the dropna() function to ensure accurate revenue calculations. Attendance rates were mapped to each hospital specialty using predefined industry averages. These rates were applied using the .map() function, allowing for precise adjustments in revenue estimates. The attendance rates used were 95% for Emergency hospitals, 93% for Emergency & Specialty hospitals, 89% for General Practice hospitals, and 89% for Mobile Services. (Source: https://www.vetport.com/Tackling-No-Show-At-Veterinary-Practice, https://www.vetport.com/Tackling-No-Show-At-Veterinary-Practice, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11231932/, https://www.veterinarypracticenews.com/handling-late-no-show-clients/) Data type conversions ensured numerical accuracy, formatting all relevant fields as floats or integers using the .astype() function. This preprocessing step prepared the dataset for mathematical operations.\nThe number of actual appointments kept was estimated using the formula Appointments Kept = Appointments × Attendance Rate. This calculation was performed using vectorized operations in pandas, allowing efficient processing of thousands of data entries. Incremental Revenue was then calculated using the formula Incremental Revenue = Appointments Kept × Revenue per Appointment. The revenue per appointment was assigned based on specialty, with Emergency hospitals averaging $2125 per appointment, Emergency & Specialty hospitals at $1000, General Practice hospitals at $100, and Mobile Services at $100. (Source: Costs of Emergency Veterinary Care: What to Know, How Much Does a Vet Visit Cost? Average Pricing By Procedure, How Much Does a Vet Visit Cost? Average Pricing By Procedure, Mobile Vet Care Costs and Pricing Comparison | The Vets) A lambda function applied these revenue rates dynamically across the dataset.\nThe final ATS values were derived using the formula ATS = Incremental Revenue / Total Calls. To prevent errors such as division by zero, np.where() was used to replace missing or zero values with NaN before computing the ratio. Once ATS was computed, the dataset was grouped by Hospital Specialty to analyze performance variations. A box plot generated using the seaborn library, and summary statistics segmented by specialty provided insights into high-revenue categories and potential areas for improvement.\nAdditional Segmentation Metrics \n\nBeyond specialty-based ATS, further segmentation opportunities include client type segmentation, service type impact, and time-based analysis. Client type segmentation involves differentiating ATS between new and returning clients to assess loyalty-driven revenue patterns. Service type impact focuses on comparing ATS for diagnostics, surgical treatments, and preventative care to identify the most profitable services. Time-based analysis examines ATS variations between peak and off-peak hours to optimize pricing strategies and staff allocation. By using segmentation metrics, GuardianVets helps veterinary hospitals optimize client communication and scheduling, highlighting the value of their services. With better call management and transparency, hospitals can demonstrate the full value of treatments, improve client trust, and ultimately maximize profitability across different service areas.",

Finally, the Additional Segmentation Metrics provide deeper insights by identifying new data opportunities and explaining how this information can enhance the underlying statistics.\n\nTangible Benefit Analysis \n\nCall Conversion Rate\nResults\nMobile Veterinary Services exhibit the highest conversion rate at 26.43%, suggesting that clients seeking mobile services are more likely to commit to an appointment once they make an inquiry. Emergency and Specialty services follow with a 6.78% conversion rate, reflecting the urgent nature of cases that often require immediate medical attention. In contrast, General Practice and standalone Emergency services demonstrate lower conversion rates at 2.66% and 2.43%, respectively, indicating potential inefficiencies or client hesitancy in scheduling appointments after an initial call. Conversion rates vary significantly across veterinary services, emphasizing the need for tailored client engagement to improve appointment scheduling efficiency.\nSource: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/138O2hoyIlJBsnt1MMmv_GEOSGx2Jjdu_#scrollTo=e6890987\nMarketing Narrative\nCall management is a major cost center for veterinary hospitals, yet often overlooked. GuardianVets doesn’t just handle overflow—it transforms how clinics manage client inquiries, reducing costs and inefficiencies.\nHiring a veterinary receptionist costs $1,633 per hire, agency recruitment jumps to $5,250, and training adds another $1,250. With high turnover, these costs add up fast. Meanwhile, GuardianVets handles around 800,000 calls annually, but CSRs can only handle around 195,000. Each call takes time away from patient care.\nBy automating client communication, GuardianVets minimizes hiring costs, optimizes staff efficiency, and ensures hospitals focus on patient care and growth—not administrative burden. Instead of just improving client engagement, GuardianVets is a financial and staffing solution that directly impacts profitability.\nMethodology\nTo calculate the Call-to-Appointment Conversion Rate (CACR), data was first extracted from Power BI, which included records of incoming calls and scheduled appointments categorized by service type: Emergency, Emergency & Specialty, General Practice, and Mobile Veterinary Services. The data was then filtered to remove incomplete, irrelevant, or duplicate records before being exported into a structured CSV format for further processing.\nFollowing data collection, a data cleaning and preprocessing phase was conducted to ensure accuracy and consistency. All missing or incomplete records were eliminated to prevent skewed analysis. Datasets from different veterinary service categories were merged into a unified DataFrame, creating a standardized dataset that allowed for cross-comparisons.\nThe Call-to-Appointment Conversion Rate was determined using the formula: (Total Appointments by specialty / Total Calls by specialty) x 100. This calculation provided a percentage-based measurement of how effectively each service type converted inquiries into scheduled appointments.\nTo validate and analyze the results, several statistical measures were applied. Descriptive statistics, including mean, median, and standard deviation, were calculated to assess trends and variations in conversion rates across service types. A seaborn boxplot was generated to visualize distribution patterns and detect potential outliers in the dataset. Additionally, a Kruskal-Wallis H-test was performed to determine whether the differences in conversion rates among the various veterinary service categories were statistically significant.\nAdditional Segmentation Metrics \nSeveral clinic-specific factors were identified that could impact conversion rates. Larger clinics with more veterinarians and front desk staff tend to manage higher call volumes, which may influence appointment scheduling efficiency. The range of services offered also plays a role, as clinics providing specialized care, emergency procedures, or telemedicine consultations often experience higher or more unpredictable call volumes. Clinics that operate 24/7 or offer weekend availability see increased inquiries, particularly for emergency cases. Call response time is another crucial factor, as quicker responses to client inquiries improve scheduling rates and overall retention.\nGeographic location also affects call-to-appointment conversion rates. Urban clinics generally receive higher call volumes due to larger pet populations and greater accessibility, while rural clinics may experience surges in emergency inquiries, particularly in regions with limited veterinary alternatives. Seasonal and regional health concerns, such as flea infestations or pet anxiety during holiday travel, also contribute to fluctuating call activity.\n\n\nAverage Transaction Size\nResults\nAverage Transaction Size (ATS) is a key financial metric used to evaluate revenue efficiency per client interaction. By analyzing ATS across different veterinary hospital specialties—Emergency, Emergency & Specialty, General Practice, and Mobile Services—this research identifies revenue generation patterns and operational efficiency. The ATS for each category is calculated as follows: Emergency hospitals have an ATS of $48.08 per call, while Emergency & Specialty hospitals have the highest ATS at $62.71 per call. General Practice hospitals show the lowest ATS at $2.32 per call, indicating lower revenue per client interaction. Mobile Services maintain a moderate ATS of $23.49 per call, suggesting a balance between accessibility and revenue efficiency.\n\nSource: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fApbPN6WSYeMfo8Hm1aqcvXX3JbO66Os#scrollTo=d825765a\nMarketing Narrative\nAverage Transaction Size (ATS) is a key metric for veterinary hospitals to demonstrate the value of their services. GuardianVets helps hospitals optimize client communication by improving appointment scheduling and reducing missed opportunities, ultimately leading to higher ATS and increased revenue.\nHospitals with higher ATS often provide advanced diagnostics, specialized treatments, and expert care, but inefficiencies in client communication can lead to missed appointments and a failure to fully convey this value. For example, an Emergency & Specialty hospital with a high ATS can market this as covering premium services—but this value can be missed if the client is unable to schedule appointments or understand the full scope of care offered.\nGuardianVets not only streamlines call management but also supports transparency in communication. By ensuring clients clearly understand what their payments cover—from diagnostic tests to imaging and treatment plans—GuardianVets enhances trust and clarity in the value of services. This improves client retention, optimizes ATS, and drives long-term profitability, all while reinforcing a hospital's commitment to clear and honest communication.\nMethodology\nThe ATS analysis was conducted through multiple stages, including data cleaning, preprocessing, revenue computation, and segmentation. The data from the four veterinary specialties were imported and merged into a single DataFrame for uniform analysis. Any missing data in the Appointments or Total Calls columns were removed using the dropna() function to ensure accurate revenue calculations. Attendance rates were mapped to each hospital specialty using predefined industry averages. These rates were applied using the .map() function, allowing for precise adjustments in revenue estimates. The attendance rates used were 95% for Emergency hospitals, 93% for Emergency & Specialty hospitals, 89% for General Practice hospitals, and 89% for Mobile Services.

This preprocessing step prepared the dataset for mathematical operations.\nThe number of actual appointments kept was estimated using the formula Appointments Kept = Appointments × Attendance Rate. This calculation was performed using vectorized operations in pandas, allowing efficient processing of thousands of data entries. Incremental Revenue was then calculated using the formula Incremental Revenue = Appointments Kept × Revenue per Appointment. The revenue per appointment was assigned based on specialty, with Emergency hospitals averaging $2125 per appointment, Emergency & Specialty hospitals at $1000, General Practice hospitals at $100, and Mobile Services at $100. (Source: Costs of Emergency Veterinary Care: What to Know, How Much Does a Vet Visit Cost? Average Pricing By Procedure, How Much Does a Vet Visit Cost? Average Pricing By Procedure, Mobile Vet Care Costs and Pricing Comparison | The Vets) A lambda function applied these revenue rates dynamically across the dataset.\nThe final ATS values were derived using the formula ATS = Incremental Revenue / Total Calls. To prevent errors such as division by zero, np.where() was used to replace missing or zero values with NaN before computing the ratio. Once ATS was computed, the dataset was grouped by Hospital Specialty to analyze performance variations. A box plot generated using the seaborn library, and summary statistics segmented by specialty provided insights into high-revenue categories and potential areas for improvement.\nAdditional Segmentation Metrics \n\nBeyond specialty-based ATS, further segmentation opportunities include client type segmentation, service type impact, and time-based analysis. Client type segmentation involves differentiating ATS between new and returning clients to assess loyalty-driven revenue patterns. Service type impact focuses on comparing ATS for diagnostics, surgical treatments, and preventative care to identify the most profitable services. Time-based analysis examines ATS variations between peak and off-peak hours to optimize pricing strategies and staff allocation. By using segmentation metrics, GuardianVets helps veterinary hospitals optimize client communication and scheduling, highlighting the value of their services. With better call management and transparency, hospitals can demonstrate the full value of treatments, improve client trust, and ultimately maximize profitability across different service areas.",
